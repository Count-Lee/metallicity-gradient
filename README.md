# metallicity-gradient
This repository includes the maps of all galaxies for paper 'A Negative Stellar Mass-Gaseous Metallicity Gradient Relation of Dwarf Galaxies Modulated by Stellar Feedback'.

The name of each image corresponds to the respective galaxy. For each galaxy, Top, from left to right: the MUSE RGB image of the galaxy based on synthetic V, I, and R band images obtained from the MUSE cubes, over-plotted with the shape of galaxy measured by isophotes in 0.2 $\rm R_e$ bin (the light ellispe represent 1 $\rm R_e$), the 2D emission-line maps of $H\alpha$ and its related velocity. {\bf The velocity of $H\alpha$ along the major or minor axis.} Bottom: left is the resolved 12+log (O/H) map and right is its radial profile. The points are color coded by its SFR, and the red triangle is the median value taken every 0.2 $R_e$ with error bars denoting the standard deviation. {\bf The dashed line corresponds to the best linear fit of the data points.
